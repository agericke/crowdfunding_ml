## 1. INTRODUCTION <a id="id1"></a>

We are planning to analyze the projects that aim to raise money in Kickstarter, one of the biggest crowdfunding platforms. The idea is to determine the key factors for a kickstarter campaign to be successful or not. Check the differences between businees categories and their success rate, and also run an analysis on the amount of money businesses want to raise and check if there are any particular aspects that may be key for success and that can be told to entrepreneurs wanting to initiate a crowdfunding campaign in Kickstarter.

We want to run also a geographic analysis, and see whether depending on where you launch the campaign may determine a major probability of raising money or not. Furthermore, once done this deep analysis on all possible variables extracted from kickstarter data, we will want to introduce new macroeconomic data, regarding financial crisis and other aspects, and check whether this new data with campaigns timlines may provide new insights and see how correlated are macroeconomic tendencies to successful crowdfuncing campaigns.

The final idea is to present a dashboard for any entrepreneur that wants to run a crowdfunding campaign in Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platform, where they can see in a friendly way all the key concepts to take into account, what amount of money tends to have the highest probability of being raised, the ideal duration of the campaign and much more other concept that can be realy valuable if you want to raise money via crowdfunding. Also we will want to be able to allow the entrepreneur to filter by business category and even by country and check the best parameters to set in their crowdfunding campaign for reaching their objective. We may consider also as an additional feature introduce data from other crowdfunding campaigns, and check if the results look similar to kickstarter or maybe differ from one platform to another
